### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project contains a simple command line application to explore data related to bike sharing activities in 3 US cities. The application allows the user to specify which city they would like to receive data on, and also provides some basic statistics for the users benefit.

### Files used
The project requires 4 files to work: 
* Bikeshare.py
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv 

### Credits
The successful completion of this project was in part facilitated by stackoverflow but primarily by the great educators involved in the Udacity "Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree".

Thank you to Udacity for all the effort put into developing this course.
